# Network Dissection in PyTorch

## TODO

- [ ] Flexible setting.py: (maybe) pre settings and post settings
- [ ] Compatibility with PyTorch 1.x
- [x] Enable vgg16, resnet18, inception_v3 trained on ImageNet
- [x] Examine the effect of different quantiles (besides the default 0.005)
- [ ] Hack data_loader.py to load different datasets
- [ ] Integrate NetDissect with different task-specific architectures
